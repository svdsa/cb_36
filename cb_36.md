## Title & Author

"Proportional Representation" by Johannes M. of Silicon Valley DSA

## Background Information

As a big-tent, multi-tendency socialist organization, DSA should strive for fair, proportional representation of all its vibrant tendencies in National leadership bodies such as the National Political Committee (NPC). This amendment adopts the common “Single Transferable Vote (STV)” system of proportional representation for NPC elections, for Local and At-Large delegate elections, and for appointments by the NPC.

In elections jargon, “proportional representation” is when divisions in an electorate are reflected proportionally in the elected body. In other words, if 40% of voters vote for a particular candidate slate, then roughly 40% of seats should be won by that slate. When proportional representation isn’t used, a narrow majority or plurality can dominate.

Proportional representation is fair to all sides, but it is especially important for protecting the rights of members in the minority. In a limited way, this is already recognized in the DSA Constitution and Bylaws: a 15% minority in a local chapter may force a local delegate election to use a method of proportional representation.

But this guarantee doesn’t extend to all elections related to National DSA. At the 2017 Convention, the election for the NPC was conducted using a non-proportional “Borda Count” method. Committee appointments by the NPC are held according to majority rule. And all chapters contain minority views, but not all chapters provided for proportional representation.
We should adopt a proportional system for all elections that relate to National DSA.
